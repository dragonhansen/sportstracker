Simple webserver that uses a python webscraper to display data about the UCI and Formula 1 race calendar.
This version will use React for the frontend and the scraped data will be saved as JSON and served upon accessing the webiste.
The scraper runs periodically such that the data is always up to date.

Currently running on: https://dragonhansen.azurewebsites.net/ (availability is not great since it is currently running on the free plan - no point in wasting money during offseason)
