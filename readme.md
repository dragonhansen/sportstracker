Simple webserver that uses a python webscraper to display data about the UCI and Formula 1 race calendar.
This version does not use a database and the HTML to display the scraped data is also generated by the Python backend.
Compared to v1.0, the HTML in this version is generated in a smarter way and the update button on the website now uses a JS fetch POST request.
